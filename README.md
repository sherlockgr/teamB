CSCI 1210 Semester Project

Bailey you're doing shop.html and your css is named shopstyle.css in the css folder. Let me know when you need quilt images and fabric images.

Ashya you're doing the aboutus.html but combining the contact page with it. Your css is named aboutus.css in the css folder. Both the contact and about us links will lead to your page. When you get to writing the about us section let me know and I'll send you a description to put there.


*** PLEASE READ ****
*** Instructions for adding styles***
* Its important to not repeat any of the style classes that we use as they can override each other.
* The css directory is set up as follows: Each stylesheet should be the name of the page your're creating the styles for. Exmaple aboutUs.css, shopStyles.css etc...
* Any global styles that need to be added to any page can go in the styles.css file. I have the footer and header styles in here specifically for that purpose.
* There is no need to keep adding the footer and header css classes to your page css files, beacause the style.css file is being included on each page. 

* Be sure to use unique style names for each of your css classes. 
* A good approach is to name it after the file. For example the about page: .about-container{}, about-row{}, about-column{}   
* Also don't just style the default html class i.e h2,div,ul,li etc because it will affect every h2,div,ul,li its better to just add a class to the element.
