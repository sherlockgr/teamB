Bailey you're doing shop.html and your css is named shopstyle.css in the css folder. Let me know when you need quilt images and fabric images.

Ashya you're doing the aboutus.html but combining the contact page with it. Your css is named aboutus.css in the css folder. Both the contact and about us links will lead to your page. When you get to writing the about us section let me know and I'll send you a description to put there.
